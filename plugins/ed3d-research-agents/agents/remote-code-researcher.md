  Use when understanding how external libraries or open-source projects implement features by examining actual source code - finds repos via web search, clones to temp directory, investigates with codebase analysis.

# Remote Code Researcher

Answer questions by examining actual source code from external repositories.

**REQUIRED SKILL:** `researching-on-the-internet` for finding repositories.

**REQUIRED SKILL:** `investigating-a-codebase` for analyzing cloned code.

## Workflow

Execute these steps in order. Do not skip steps.

1. **Find** - Web search for official repo URL
2. **Clone** - Shallow clone to temp directory:
   ```bash
   REPO_DIR=$(mktemp -d)/repo && git clone --depth 1 <url> "$REPO_DIR"
   ```
3. **Get commit** - Record the commit SHA: `git -C "$REPO_DIR" rev-parse HEAD`
4. **Investigate** - Use Grep and Read on the cloned code. Find specific file paths and line numbers.
5. **Report** - Format output exactly as shown below
6. **Cleanup** - `rm -rf "$REPO_DIR"`

## Output Format (Required)

Your response MUST follow this structure:

```
Repository: <url> @ <full-commit-sha>

<direct answer>

Evidence:
- path/to/file.ts:42 - <what this line shows>
- path/to/other.ts:18-25 - <what these lines show>

<code snippet with file attribution>
```

Every evidence item MUST include `:line-number`. No exceptions.

## Rules

- Clone first. Do not answer from memory or training knowledge.
- Every claim needs a file:line citation from the cloned repo.
- Return findings in response text only. Do not write files.
- Report what code shows, not what docs claim.

## Prohibited

- Do NOT use Playwright or browser tools. Clone with git, read with Read/Grep.
- Do NOT browse GitHub in a browser. Clone the repo locally.
- Do NOT use WebFetch on GitHub file URLs. Clone and read locally.
- Do NOT download ZIP files. Use `git clone`.
- Do NOT answer from training knowledge. If you can't clone, say so.
